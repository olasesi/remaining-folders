In addition to the curve of the monitor, users benefit from a WQHD 2560 x 1440 viewing experience, a 100,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio, a 4 ms response time, and support for up to 16.7 million colors. Included with this monitor are Acer's own Vision Care features offering Flicker-less and Blue-light Filtering technologies. These technologies are designed to reduce the strain placed on your eyes during periods of extended viewing. To further enhance your viewing experience, the display can be tilted from -5 to 15° and it can be viewed from nearly any angle with support for 178° horizontal and vertical viewing angles. Setup and configuration of the ED273 display is simple as it comes equipped with DVI, HDMI, and Display Port for compatibility with a variety of computers.Curved ScreenThe ""R"" is the measure of how curved a curve is. An 1800R curve, for example, means that if the curve were to make a complete circle, that circle would have a radius of 71"" or 6'. Essentially, this means the lower the R number, the greater the curve.Wide Angle DisplayConventional monitors change their color and have image distortion when viewing from different angles. WVA monitors allow the screen to be viewed from 178° and preserve image clarity and prime colors.High-Speed ResponseA rapid 4 ms response time ensures images appear clearly as they quickly move across the display.","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/AcerMonitor1/Acer ET322QR Wmiix Monitor-Obejor (1).jpg","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=2716","Acer Cpu & Monitor","acer","180000 NGN","NGN","in stock","2716","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=2716","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/AcerMonitor1/acer-et322qr-wmiix-315-inch-curved-full-hd-monitor-with-speakers-umje2aa004-Obejor (1).jpg,https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/AcerMonitor1/acer-et322qr-wmiix-315-inch-curved-full-hd-monitor-Obejor (1).jpg","1970-01-30T00:00+00:00/1970-01-30T23:59+00:00","180000 NGN","new"

Maximum Input Current - 13.0AProduct DistributionProtection of data lines (Ethernet, Coaxial and Phone lines) ensures 
complete protection of your equipment from surges. It is very important 
to protect your equipment from “back door” electric surges traveling 
through data lines, as they can be as damaging to your equipment as 
surges traveling over power lines.Easy recovery from overloads; no need to replace a fuse. (Not available on Wall Tap SKUs)
Catastrophic Event Protection

SurgeArrest components such as MOVs and Thermal fuse ensure instantaneous reaction to lightning strikes and wiring faults. If the surge components are damaged due to power spike or over voltage, excess power cannot reach your equipment. 
Unlike the APC SurgeArrest products, most surge suppressors continue to 
let power through even after circuits have been damaged, leaving your 
equipment exposed to other damaging surges.
Protection Working Indicator

SurgeArrest will warn you if its circuitry has been damaged by heavy 
strike or power line surge and it is unable to provide 100% protection. 
If still under warranty, APC will then replace your damaged SurgeArrest 
free of charge.","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/APC/PM5-UK (1).jpg","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3866","Mid-year Clearance Price Slash","APC","10000 NGN","NGN","in stock","3866","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3866","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/APC/61ZixZ0GKKL._AC_SL1500_ (1).jpg,https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/APC/PM5-UK PRICE (1).jpg","1970-01-30T00:00+00:00/1970-01-30T23:59+00:00","10000 NGN","new"

Key FeaturesNominal Input Voltage - 230V



Input Connections - British BS1363A



Cord Length - 1.83meters



Maximum Input Current - 13.0AIEEE let-through ratings and regulatory agency compliance

APC surge protectors undergo stringent testing by IEEE and are awarded 
""let-through ratings"", which indicate the maximum voltage level that can
 possibly reach your equipment after a surge or voltage spike has passed
 through a surge protector. Lower IEEE let-through ratings indicate 
better protection and performance. The APC Essential SurgeArrest series 
offers optimal performance with a let-through rating of less than 330V 
for North American products, and a rating of less than 15% for products 
sold worldwide. All APC products comply with local agency safety 
requirements, including UL in North America and 
CE/Kema/Gost/C-tick/A-Tick/Telepermit in their respective regions.
Data-line Protection

Protection of data lines 
(Ethernet, Coaxial and Phone lines) ensures complete protection of your 
equipment from surges. It is very important to protect your equipment 
from “back door” electric surges traveling through data lines, as they 
can be as damaging to your equipment as surges traveling over power

Just pull them out of the case and they’re ready to use with your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac.After a simple one-tap setup, AirPods work like magic. They’re automatically on and always connected. AirPods can even sense when they’re in your ears and pause when you take them out.To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, simply say “Hey Siri” and make your request. You have the freedom to wear one or both AirPods, and you can play or skip forward with a double-tap when listening to music or podcasts.Charge your AirPods quickly and easily with the Wireless Charging Case. Just set the case down on a Qi-compatible charging mat and let it charge. The LED indicator on the front of the case lets you know that your AirPods are charging. And when you're away from a charging mat, you can use the Lightning port to charge.AirPods deliver 5 hours of listening time1 and 3 hours of talk time on a single charge.2 And they’re made to keep up with you, thanks to a charging case that holds multiple charges for more than 24 hours of listening time.3 Need a quick charge? Just 15 minutes in the case gives you 3 hours of listening time4 or 2 hours of talk time.5Powered by the all-new Apple H1 headphone chip, AirPods use optical sensors and motion accelerometers to detect when they’re in your ears. Whether you’re using both AirPods or just one, the H1 chip automatically routes the audio and engages the microphone. And when you’re on a call or talking to Siri, an additional speech-detecting accelerometer works with beamforming microphones to filter out external noise and focus on the sound of your voice.Power and Battery    AirPods with Charging Case: More than 24 hours listening time,3 up to 18 hours talk time8    AirPods (single charge): Up to 5 hours listening time,1 up to 3 hours talk time    15 minutes in the case equals up to 3 hours listening time or up to 2 hours talk time","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/Headset/Apple AirPods 2 with Wireless Charging Case (1).jpg","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=4128","Bluetooth Headset","Apple","30000 NGN","NGN","in stock","4128","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=4128","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/Headset/Apple AirPods 2 with Wireless Charging Case Review.jpg,https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/Headset/Apple AirPods 2 with Wireless Charging.jpg,https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/Headset/Apple AirPods 2 with Wireless Charging Case price (1).jpg,https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/Headset/Apple AirPods 2 with Wireless Charging Case in obejor.jpg,https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/Headset/Apple AirPods 2 (1).jpg","1970-01-30T00:00+00:00/1970-01-30T23:59+00:00","30000 NGN","new"

The difference is stark especially if you're one of those people who likes to keep an eye on the time without having to vigorously move your wrist every time you want to do so. Whether the screen is on or off the high-contrast screen really pops showing those vibrant colors be it your exercise rings or a message from a friend. We've also found we can stop doing that crazy wrist flick that you see Apple Watch owners do and means on a run when you raise your hand the screen is on ready for you to read without delay. To help conserve battery and make things easier to see at a glance, many of the Watch faces change color when not active. The new California watch face goes from a colored face to black and white, for example, Mickey all but disappears apart from his hands, while others lose other elements accordingly. You can of course turn the always-on functionality off.

But be warned: if you forget to charge it nightly you won't make it through to the next day. Some of that comes down to having a vibrant and glorious display and since the bump in size on the Series 4, there are few watches that can really compare on quality of display - although that's what eats into the battery.SpecificationsAlways-On Retina display with Force TouchLTPO OLED display (1000 nits)GPS/GNSSBuilt-in CompassS5 with 64-bit dual-core processorW3 Apple wireless chipBarometric altimeterOptical heart sensorElectrical heart sensorAccelerometer up to 32 g-forcesGyroscopeImproved ambient light sensorCapacity 32GDigital Crown with haptic feedbackSpeakerIon-X strengthened glassSapphire crystal and ceramic bacWi-Fi (802.11b/g/n 2.4GHz)Bluetooth 5.0Built-in rechargeable lithium-ion batteryUp to 18 hours of battery lifeWater resistant 50 metersApple Watch Series 5 44mmBand (can be configured for S/M or M/L length)1m Magnetic Charging Cable5w","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/SmartWatchs/Apple Watch Series 5-Obejor (1).jpg","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=2399","Apple","Apple","199000 NGN","NGN","in stock","2399","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=2399","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/SmartWatchs/Apple Watch Series 5 44mm-Obejor (1).jpg","1970-01-30T00:00+00:00/1970-01-30T23:59+00:00","199000 NGN","new"

Taken right to the edge.Over Detailed DesignThis iMac was created with as much amazing technological innovation as the amazing look it has. Through a painstaking process of designing and engineering everything about iMac from the inside out, the result of an advanced, elegant all-in-one computer that looks as much a work of art as it is state of the art was come about.Phenomenal Lengths and WidthsWith an iMac in front of you, the world around you seems to disappear as you lose yourself to the big and beautiful display. By pushing every limit, considering every detail, and advancing the iMac in amazing ways, an immersive experience has been created.Ultimate All-in-OneThe first iMac was a revolution: An all-in-one computer that put everything — display, processor, graphics, storage, memory, and more — inside one simple, stylish enclosure. This iMac has been improved beyond the even revolutionary iMacs before it and made to include a brilliant desktop display and filled with the latest high-performance technologies yet at 5 mm thinness.Seamless Design With a 5mm EdgeSurmounting the challenge of joining the iMac seamlessly without foregoing the dream of a 5mm thin desk computer has become a huge success story for the iMac creation team. The enclosure is so thin, it is humanly impossible to weld the pieces using traditional methods, so a process called friction-stir welding used on airplane wings, rocket booster tanks, and other parts that simply must not fail was found and used after much research. It's commonly used on airplane wings, rocket booster tanks, and other parts that simply can't fail. This process uses a combination of intense friction-generated heat and pressure to intermix the molecules of the two aluminum surfaces — creating a seamless, precise, and superstrong join. You may not see it, but this iMac wouldn't be possible without it.Warning: You May Get Too Engrossed With the Beautiful, Widescreen Display Right Where The Action IsInstead of being set behind the cover glass, the iMac display is set right up against it. By using an advanced process called full lamination, the gap between the LCD panel and the glass is eliminated so that every image looks as if it is right with you in person.Low ReflectionFull lamination has a second major benefit, eliminating the reflection of light off the LCD panel and off the back of the display's cover glass. But an extra effort was added to reduce reflection off the front of the glass without compromising color quality. Instead of applying an anti-reflective coating to the glass in a conventional way, a process used on smaller surfaces like camera lenses and on the helmets of fighter pilots was adapted; plasma deposition involves coating the glass with precise and thin layers of silicon dioxide and niobium pentoxide measured in atoms to give an astoundingly low reflection with vibrant, accurate colors.Individually Calibrated for True-to-Life ColourThe real reason all the innovations on this iMac makes sense is that every display was put through an exacting color-calibration process using state-of-the-art spectroradiometers, equipment that is tuned to meet color standards recognized around the world for precision and accuracy, engineering the screen to deliver vivid and true-to-life colors.Highly Recyclable and Energy Efficient for an iMac of The EnvironmentEfficiency of EnergyiMac is designed to be more energy-efficient than ever so it uses just 0.9 watts of electricity when in sleep mode, a beyond far cry from what is obtainable from the previous iMac model.Friendly with the Environment iMac is made of materials like already recycled aluminum and glass so it has a higher likelihood of being recycled or used and it is made free of many harmful toxins, including mercury, arsenic, BFRs, and PVC.Designed with Responsibility in MindGoing the extra mile for the iMac shows up all through, even in the set rules and standards of EPA, which has earned it the 6.1 qualifications on ENERGY STAR Version; the highest rating of Gold from EPEAT, which evaluates the environmental impact of a product based on how recyclable it is, how much energy it uses, and how it's designed and manufactured.Brilliant Front and Back of ScreenLooking at the gorgeous widescreen iMac display will be so engrossing that nothing will qualify for a distraction because it is designed with a reduction in reflection and the LCD is right up against the display glass to help you see your photos, games, movies and everything else in vivid, lifelike detail.An Amazing View, Amazing HandlingThe iMac comes with a combination of","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/apple1.jpg","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=4322","Imac","Apple","1078000 NGN","NGN","in stock","4322","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=4322","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/apple3.jpg,https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/apple2.jpg","1970-01-30T00:00+00:00/1970-01-30T23:59+00:00","1078000 NGN","new"

"2171","Apple iPad Pro -12.9-inches,3rd generation- 64GB ROM 4GB RAM - WIFI + Cellular- 2018","Product detailsTo Apple's credit, this is the easiest 12.9-inch iPad to actually hold and use. It certainly doesn't hurt that its designers trimmed a full inch off the big Pro's height and shaved around two-tenths of a pound off the body. That might not sound like a huge difference, but because Apple concentrated the tablet's weight into a smaller footprint, this iPad feels much easier to manage. I've spent the past week using the Pro to work on this review, read on subways, watch election results while nursing a fever in bed, and more -- in short, I've been trying to rely on it as much as possible, and it never felt as cumbersome or unwieldy as its predecessors. If nothing else, Apple has succeeded in building a big tablet that doesn't really feel like one. And then there's the screen. The 12.9-inch ""Liquid Retina"" display has the same 2,732 x 2,048 resolution as earlier models did, and it's about as nice a screen as you'll find on a tablet right now. That said, I'm pretty sure at least a few of you are disappointed that Apple didn't embrace OLED panels here the way it did in its recent flagship iPhones. That was almost certainly a decision made to keep the iPad Pro's cost at least somewhat manageable, and honestly, the decision doesn't come with many downsides. This LCD is capable of rendering bright, beautiful colors, to the point where I've found it gives the iPhone XS's OLED screen a run for its money. Even better, the display can (once again) refresh at a rate of up to 120Hz, so on-screen motion tends to look remarkably smooth. Apple calls this its ProMotion display technology, and it's just as impressive now as it was when I first tested it -- if you're not careful, it'll spoil nearly every other tablet screen for you. My gripes here are few: the screen's pixel density technically falls short of that on devices like the iPhone XS and XS Max, but that's less troublesome than the fact that the screen is a veritable fingerprint magnet. It' also worth noting that, for now at least, most of the apps I've tested don't actually fill the entire screen. Many of them get pretty close by displaying thin black bars at the top and bottom of the display where the time, date, and gesture bar live, and I'd imagine fixing this in an update wouldn't be too difficult. Others, however, are much worse. Spotify is a great example (or a terrible one, depending on how you look at it). In addition to those top and bottom bars, the Spotify app window is also flanked on the left and right by black bars. These sorts of apps effectively double the size of the bezels, making your sleek new iPad look a bit like an older model. Here's hoping these all get fixed, and soon. Rounding out the iPad's new design is a pair of cameras. The 7-megapixel front-facing TrueDepth camera (plus the extra bits that power Face ID) was pulled straight out of the iPhone XS and wedged above the iPad's screen. Or is it squeezed next to the screen? It's kind of hard to say this year. Apple design chief Jony Ive said in an interview with The Independent that the new Pro ""doesn't have an orientation."" That is to say, now that Face ID is here and the home button is gone, you can pick up and use the iPad any which way you need to. In practice, that's not entirely true, since you have to make sure not to obscure the front camera when grabbing the iPad, but I've is mostly right. It doesn't hurt that this second-gen Face ID sensor is very fast at recognizing the person in front of it, even if it's looking at them from below or at a weird angle.The iPad's 12-megapixel rear camera, meanwhile, is perfectly adequate. I fully expected Apple to use the same wide-angle camera we tested in this year's iPhone XS and XR, but nope! Because this iPad is so thin, Apple had to use a new, more compact sensor to fit behind the display. As a result, the photos here aren't quite as good as ones captured with any of Apple's newest phones, but honestly, when was the last time you took a photo with an iPad? The camera's quality is solid enough that I wouldn't call it an afterthought, but Apple clearly had different priorities here. There's no portrait mode, for instance, an omission that's especially weird, since the iPhone X R proved Apple could pull off bo keh-filled portrait shots with a single rear camera. The one other caveat is that the rear camera juts out of the iPad's back, as opposed to sitting flush like it did on earlier models. You'd think this would lead to some wobbling or instability when the iPad is laid flat on a table, but I've never had a problem there.Available onnline in Nigeria at Obejor.com your number one online store.","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/Appleipad/Apple Ipad pro 12.9-2018 (1).jpg","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=2171","Ipad","Apple","398000 NGN","NGN","in stock","2171","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=2171","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/Appleipad/Apple iPad pro 12.9-256gb (1).jpg,https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/Appleipad/Apple ipad 12.9-2018 (1).jpg","1970-01-30T00:00+00:00/1970-01-30T23:59+00:00","398000 NGN","new"

It offers far more power than most PC laptops, yet is delightfully simple to use. The redesigned Retina display is as stunning to look at as it is to touch. And it all comes together with iOS, the world's most advanced mobile operating system. iPad Pro. Everything you want modern computing to be. Now even, well, better. iPad has always offered the ultimate Multi-Touch experience. The redesigned Retina display on iPad Pro sets a whole new standard. It's not just brighter and less reflective, it's far more responsive than anything that's come before. Whether you're scrolling through pages in Safari or playing an intense 3D game, everything feels utterly smooth, fast, and immersive. The new 10.5-inch iPad Pro comes with a screen that is nearly 20 percent larger than the 9.7-inch model, so you get more room to do more. It also delivers a full-size onscreen keyboard. Yet it's just as portable as ever. The new iPad Pro Retina display now supports a 120Hz refresh rate. So movies and videos look spectacular, while games play smoothly without distracting artifacts. Fast, it turns out, is incredibly beautiful. And however you use the display - with your finger or Apple Pencil - everything will feel more responsive. Doing more than ever will soon be easier than ever. In iOS, an all-new Dock makes it simple to open recently used apps and files. And when you use Slide Over or Split View, both apps will stay active so you can work with them simultaneously, to edit an image in Adobe Photoshop Fix while creating a web page or use Safari to plan your next vacation while confirming dates in Calendar.With the introduction of the 10.5"" iPad Pro, Apple provides users with 256GB of storage and a 10.5"" IPS Retina display that is 20% larger than their 9.7"" model, while reducing its border size by nearly 40%. The result is a tablet that weighs just over 1 lb and also features a 12-core GPU, a screen resolution of 2224 x 1668, 264 pixels per inch (PPI), a refresh rate of 120 Hz, a brightness of 600 cd/m2, support for the P3 color gamut, 20 ms latency, and an anti-reflective coating with 1.8% reflectivity. All of this helps to deliver high-resolution videos and photos with vivid colors, deep blacks, greater contrast, and more uniform brightness.Powering the large Retina display is the Apple A10X Six-Core chip with an M10 motion coprocessor. This 64-bit chip can pump out desktop-class CPU performance and console-class graphics. The faster performance allows you to multitask with ease, using iOS 10 features, such as Picture in Picture, Slide Over, and Split View. Also, the iPad Pro is capable of editing 4K video, rendering 3D models/images, creating/editing complex documents and presentations, and playing games.The iPad Pro comes with iOS 10 installed, which features proactive assistance as well as powerful search and improved Siri features, all while protecting your privacy. There are multitasking features designed specifically for iPad which allow you to use multiple apps simultaneously, and built-in apps become more powerful with Notes, detailed transit information in Maps, and the News app. The foundation of iOS is even stronger with software updates that require less space to install and advanced security features to further protect your device.While the Retina Display of the iPad Pro features multi-touch capabilities, Apple does offer alternative ways of interacting with the iPad Pro. The Apple Pencil is an optional accessory that can capture twice as many data points as your finger for greater precision.

"4506","Apple IPad Pro 11-inches,1st generation (4GB RAM, 64GB ROM)- WiFi + Cellular 7812 mAh battery Nigeri","Product detailsTo Apple's credit, this is the easiest 11-inch iPad to actually hold and use. It certainly doesn't hurt that its designers trimmed a full inch off the big Pro's height and shaved around two-tenths of a pound off the body. That might not sound like a huge difference, but because Apple concentrated the tablet's weight into a smaller footprint, this iPad feels much easier to manage. I've spent the past week using the Pro to work on this review, read on subways, watch election results while nursing a fever in bed and more -- in short, I've been trying to rely on it as much as possible, and it never felt as cumbersome or unwieldy as its predecessors. If nothing else, Apple has succeeded in building a big tablet that doesn't really feel like one. And then there's the screen. The 11-inch ""Liquid Retina"" display has the same 2,732 x 2,048 resolution as earlier models did, and it's about as nice a screen as you'll find on a tablet right now. That said, I'm pretty sure at least a few of you are disappointed that Apple didn't embrace OLED panels here the way it did in its recent flagship iPhones. That was almost certainly a decision made to keep the iPad Pro's cost at least somewhat manageable, and honestly, the decision doesn't come with many downsides. This LCD is capable of rendering bright, beautiful colors, to the point where I've found it gives the iPhone XS's OLED screen a run for its money. Even better, the display can (once again) refresh at a rate of up to 120Hz, so on-screen motion tends to look remarkably smooth. Apple calls this its ProMotion display technology, and it's just as impressive now as it was when I first tested it -- if you're not careful, it'll spoil nearly every other tablet screen for you. My gripes here are few: the screen's pixel density technically falls short of that on devices like the iPhone XS and XS Max, but that's less troublesome than the fact that the screen is a veritable fingerprint magnet. It's also worth noting that, for now at least, most of the apps I've tested don't actually fill the entire screen. Many of them get pretty close by displaying thin black bars at the top and bottom of the display where the time, date, and gesture bar live, and I'd imagine fixing this in an update wouldn't be too difficult. Others, however, are much worse. Spotify is a great example (or a terrible one, depending on how you look at it). In addition to those top and bottom bars, the Spotify app window is also flanked on the left and right by black bars. These sorts of apps effectively double the size of the bezels, making your sleek new iPad look a bit like an older model. Here's hoping these all get fixed, and soon. Rounding out the iPad's new design is a pair of cameras. The 7-megapixel front-facing True Depth camera (plus the extra bits that power Face ID) was pulled straight out of the iPhone XS and wedged above the iPad's screen. Or is it squeezed next to the screen? It's kind of hard to say this year. Apple design chief Jony Ive said in an interview with The Independent that the new Pro ""doesn't have an orientation."" That is to say, now that Face ID is here and the home button is gone, you can pick up and use the iPad any which way you need to. In practice, that's not entirely true, since you have to make sure not to obscure the front camera when grabbing the iPad, but I've is mostly right. It doesn't hurt that this second-gen Face ID sensor is very fast at recognizing the person in front of it, even if it's looking at them from below or at a weird angle.The iPad's 12-megapixel rear camera, meanwhile, is perfectly adequate. I fully expected Apple to use the same wide-angle camera we tested in this year's iPhone XS and XR, but nope! Because this iPad is so thin, Apple had to use a new, more compact sensor to fit behind the display. As a result, the photos here aren't quite as good as ones captured with any of Apple's newest phones, but honestly, when was the last time you took a photo with an iPad? The camera's quality is solid enough that I wouldn't call it an afterthought, but Apple clearly had different priorities here. There's no portrait mode, for instance, an omission that's especially weird, since the iPhone XR proved Apple could pull off bokeh-filled portrait shots with a single rear camera. The one other caveat is that the rear camera juts out of the iPad's back, as opposed to sitting flush like it did on earlier models. You'd think this would lead to some wobbling or instability when the iPad is laid flat on a table, but I've never had a problem there. The new 12.9-inch iPad Pro features an advanced Liquid Retina display that goes edge to edge.¹ Face ID, so you can securely unlock iPad Pro, log in to apps, and pay with just a glance.

"4516","Apple IPAD PRO 12.9 inches 3rd generation- 256GB ROM 4GB RAM WIFI + Cellular- 2018 Edition internati","Product detailsTo Apple's credit, this is the easiest 12.9-inch iPad to actually hold and use. It certainly doesn't hurt that its designers trimmed a full inch off the big Pro's height and shaved around two-tenths of a pound off the body. That might not sound like a huge difference, but because Apple concentrated the tablet's weight into a smaller footprint, this iPad feels much easier to manage. I've spent the past week using the Pro to work on this review, read on subways, watch election results while nursing a fever in bed, and more -- in short, I've been trying to rely on it as much as possible, and it never felt as cumbersome or unwieldy as its predecessors. If nothing else, Apple has succeeded in building a big tablet that doesn't really feel like one. And then there's the screen. The 12.9-inch ""Liquid Retina"" display has the same 2,732 x 2,048 resolution as earlier models did, and it's about as nice a screen as you'll find on a tablet right now. That said, I'm pretty sure at least a few of you are disappointed that Apple didn't embrace OLED panels here the way it did in its recent flagship iPhones. That was almost certainly a decision made to keep the iPad Pro's cost at least somewhat manageable, and honestly, the decision doesn't come with many downsides. This LCD is capable of rendering bright, beautiful colors, to the point where I've found it gives the iPhone XS's OLED screen a run for its money. Even better, the display can (once again) refresh at a rate of up to 120Hz, so on-screen motion tends to look remarkably smooth. Apple calls this its ProMotion display technology, and it's just as impressive now as it was when I first tested it -- if you're not careful, it'll spoil nearly every other tablet screen for you. My gripes here are few: the screen's pixel density technically falls short of that on devices like the iPhone XS and XS Max, but that's less troublesome than the fact that the screen is a veritable fingerprint magnet It's also worth noting that, for now at least, most of the apps I've tested don't actually fill the entire screen. Many of them get pretty close by displaying thin black bars at the top and bottom of the display where the time, date and gesture bar live, and I'd imagine fixing this in an update wouldn't be too difficult. Others, however, are much worse. Spotify is a great example (or a terrible one, depending on how you look at it). In addition to those top and bottom bars, the Spotify app window is also flanked on the left and right by black bars. These sorts of apps effectively double the size of the bezels, making your sleek new iPad look a bit like an older model. Here's hoping these all get fixed, and soon. Rounding out the iPad's new design is a pair of cameras. The 7-megapixel front-facing True Depth camera (plus the extra bits that power Face ID) was pulled straight out of the iPhone XS and wedged above the iPad's screen. Or is it squeezed next to the screen? It's kind of hard to say this year. Apple design chief Jony Ive said in an interview with The Independent that the new Pro ""doesn't have an orientation."" That is to say, now that Face ID is here and the home button is gone, you can pick up and use the iPad any which way you need to. In practice, that's not entirely true, since you have to make sure not to obscure the front camera when grabbing the iPad, but I've is mostly right. It doesn't hurt that this second-gen Face ID sensor is very fast at recognizing the person in front of it, even if it's looking at them from below or at a weird angle.The iPad's 12-megapixel rear camera, meanwhile, is perfectly adequate. I fully expected Apple to use the same wide-angle camera we tested in this year's iPhone XS and XR, but nope! Because this iPad is so thin, Apple had to use a new, more compact sensor to fit behind the display. As a result, the photos here aren't quite as good as ones captured with any of Apple's newest phones, but honestly, when was the last time you took a photo with an iPad? The camera's quality is solid enough that I wouldn't call it an afterthought, but Apple clearly had different priorities here. There's no portrait mode, for instance, an omission that's especially weird, since the iPhone X R proved Apple could pull off bokeh-filled portrait shots with a single rear camera. The one other caveat is that the rear camera juts out of the iPad's back, as opposed to sitting flush like it did on earlier models. You'd think this would lead to some wobbling or instability when the iPad is laid flat on a table, but I've never had a problem there.

The Apple iPad Pro 12.9” is the ultimate expression of that vision. It’s unlike any iPad before. The new iPad Pro features an all-new, all-screen design, but it’s not just any screen, it’s the most advanced display on the planet. And with less volume and more screen than ever, there’s more room to create, work and watch. The Liquid Retina display features industry-leading color accuracy, so you see true-to-life color from one rounded corner to the other. Using a process called subpixel anti-aliasing; Apple rounded the corners by tuning individual pixels for smooth, distortion-free edges. True Tone dynamically adjusts white balance so images on the display look natural and are easier on your eyes. ","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/200940_N7ranyTy3.jpg","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=4518","Ipad","Apple","425000 NGN","NGN","in stock","4518","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=4518","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/Appleipad/ipad-pro-12-select-wifi-spacegray-Obejor.jpg,https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/Appleipad/Apple iPad pro 12.9''-Obejor.jpg","1970-01-30T00:00+00:00/1970-01-30T23:59+00:00","425000 NGN","new"

Bar that difference, all devices are unique in their IP68 rating – ensuring dust and water resistance.Finally, the scratch-resistant glass and oleo phobic coating on the front/back glass panels ensure minimal smears and damages to the face of the phone in multiple conditions.","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/Apple IPhone 11 64gb.jpg","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3243","Obejor Online Store","Obejor Online Store","340000 NGN","NGN","in stock","3243","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3243","","1970-01-30T00:00+00:00/1970-01-30T23:59+00:00","340000 NGN","new"

With 3D Touch, your phone responds in even more subtle ways, you don't just press, you feel.  The Lightweight ChampionAdd a slim, sleek design to an amazing size. The iPhone 7 is light as a 
feather at just 138 grams, it defies all your expectations. You have to feel it to understand.iPhone
 7 Plus doesn’t have just one entirely new camera system — it has two. 
The same 12MP wide-angle camera that’s on iPhone 7 works with a 12MP telephoto camera that can get even closer. That means you can get higher-quality zoom from farther away. And with an all-new 
depth-of-field effect (coming soon), portrait shots will look better than ever. Say hello to the world’s best photo op.Capture Every Detail In ColourBring your best moments to life with the iPhone 7's 12MP camera and 7MP HD Face time camera.

And with advanced new features like wide color capture, your photos, and Live Photos are as true to life as they will ever be.iOS 10With an all-new design and all-new features, iOS 10 is the world’s most advanced mobile OS. It brings your iPhone to life in more intelligent and expressive ways than ever.A10 Fusion- Performance At The Speed Of Light2
 times faster than the iPhone 6 with the longest battery life ever in an
 iPhone, say hi to the A10 Fusion Chip, the most powerful chip ever in a
 smartphone. The A10 Fusion chip introduces an all-new architecture that
 enables faster processing when you need it, and makes it possible to 
use even less power when you don’t. So, work at twice the speed of 
iPhone 6 and still enjoy more time between charges.Audio - Introducing AirPodsEarPods
 with a Lightning connector is the new way to go! If you, however, find it difficult to detach from your old headphones, you can plug them in using a 3.5 mm headphone jack adapter, (also included). The iPhone 7 
also introduces stereo speakers which deliver twice the audio output of 
iPhone 6s and an increased dynamic range. So whether you’re listening to
 music, watching videos, or making speakerphone calls, the iPhone 7 
changes the game of your audio experience. Wifi and Worldwide Roaming Just Got BetterWith
 advanced LTE that provides speeds up to 450 Mbps for data downloads — over 50 percent faster than iPhone 6s and three times faster than iPhone 6.6, the iPhone 7 makes traveling easier. You even have more LTE bands, which guarantees the best worldwide roaming available in a smartphone. SPECIFICATIONSDisplayRetina HD display4.7-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit widescreenMulti-Touch display with IPS technology1334-by-750-pixel resolution at 326 PPI1400:1 contrast ratio (typical)Wide color display (P3)625 cd/m2 max brightness (typical)Dual-domain pixels for wide viewing anglesFingerprint-resistant oleophobic coatingSupport for display of multiple languages and characters simultaneouslyDisplay ZoomReachabilitySplash, Water, and Dust ResistantRated IP67 under IEC standard 60529ChipA10 Fusion chip with 64-bit architectureEmbedded M10 motion coprocessorCamera12MP camera ƒ/1.8 aperture Digital zoom up to 5xOptical image stabilizationSix‑element lensQuad-LED True Tone flashPanorama (up to 63 megapixels)Sapphire crystal lens coverBackside illumination sensorHybrid IR filterAutofocus with Focus PixelsTap to focus with Focus PixelsLive Photos with st","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/iphones/Apple iPhone 7plus 32gb rom gold in Obejor (1).jpg","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3509","Apple","Apple","216000 NGN","NGN","in stock","3509","https://www.obejor.com.ng/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3509","https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/iphones/Apple iPhone 7plus 3gb ram 32gb in Obejor (1).jpg,https://www.obejor.com.ng/image/catalog/appel phone/iphone7-plus-rosegold-select-2016.jpg","1970-01-30T00:00+00:00/1970-01-30T23:59+00:00","216000 NGN","new"

That includes placing calls, receiving messages, using Siri, navigating via Maps, playing with third-party apps, and just about anything else.You can't sign up for a separate Apple Watch cellular plan from your iPhone.

 a resolution of 2560-by-1600 for over 4 million pixels, the results are positively jaw-dropping. Images take on a new level of detail and realism. The text is sharp and clear. And True Tone technology automatically adjusts the white point of the display to match the colour temperature of your environment - making web pages and email look as natural as the printed page. With 48 per cent more colours than the previous generation, 
everything you see is rich and vibrant. The display glass goes right to the edge of the enclosure, making the borders 50 per cent thinner than before. So you can focus on what's on your screen. And you're going to love what you see.Touch ID: your fingerprint is your passwordThe
 advanced security and convenience of Touch ID are now built right into 
MacBook Air. Simply place your finger on the Touch ID sensor and - just like that - your Mac unlocks. Use your fingerprint to immediately access locked documents, notes, and system settings, without entering yet another password. Online shopping is even easier - select Apple Pay at checkout, and with just one touch you're done. No need to enter shipping or billing info and your card details are never shared. With Touch ID,
 your private information stays private.Keyboard: a real hands-on experienceThe
 next-generation MacBook Air keyboard features the butterfly mechanism -
 providing four times more key stability than a traditional scissor mechanism, along with greater comfort and responsiveness. And individual
 LED-backlit keys with an ambient light sensor help you type in 
low-light environments.Force Touch TrackpadThe
 Force Touch trackpad lets you interact with your Mac in a variety of ways based on subtle differences in pressure. You have precise control and a uniform response - no matter where you click the trackpad - as well as plenty of room for Multi-Touch gestures like pinch and zoom.
